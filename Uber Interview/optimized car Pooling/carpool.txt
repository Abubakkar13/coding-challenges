This could be solved using minimum spanning tree concept

                              ***assume taxi is large enough for all passengers****

Arrange all the pickup locations as vertices of a graph along with the present location of the taxi as one of the vertex

now start with the present location and add that edge with has lowest weight ,this means we have visited to the location which is nearby and pic all the passangers, then search for the next nearby locations and so on until all the locations are visited once
